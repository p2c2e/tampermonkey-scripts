# tampermonkey-scripts

You can install the scripts to [TamperMonkey (Chrome)](http://tampermonkey.net/) or [GreaseMonkey (Firefox)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) by clicking the links below. 
You will get an opportunity to review the code.

Why would you need this?

I used to maintain my accounts using [GnuCash](https://www.gnucash.org/) - Since very few Indian banks provide online transaction APIs, I used these scripts to scrape the page and populate GnuCash.
